# Hello, I'm JB

I am a student at Western Governors University and I'm studying for a bachelors degree in cybersecurity. I've had an interest in computers since I was young, however I never really thought about it as a career; It wasn't until October of 2024 did I decide to start pursuing and studying for a career in IT. Since then I have been very focused on pivoting over to IT, and having had some years of hobbyist experience ranging from troubleshooting my own PC issues, as well as friends' to completing labs in both TryHackMe, HackTheBox, CyberDefenders, etc. I occassionally post write-ups for projects I've done to my medium which are linked below. I am currently doing labs and CTFs relating to the role of SOC analyst, and have been deep diving into forensics and the different tools and methods used in uncovering information in computer systems.

## Objective

My hobby in computers has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field and graduate by the summer of 2026.
